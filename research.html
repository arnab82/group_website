				<h3><b>Strong correlation in molecules</b></h3>
				Entangled electrons in molecular magnets, strongly correlated transition metal catalysts, 
				many of our most important problems are not easily modelled with conventional quantum chemistry. 
				We have an on-going interest in developing new tools for the computational chemist to 
				efficiently model systems containing strongly correlated electrons.

				<p>
				One approach to this problem is to consider tensor decompositions as a way to decrease the complexity of representing strongly correlated systems. 
				In <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00696">an initial study</a>, we have developed a strategy based on the Tucker decomposition
				to approximate a system of semi-separable clusters in a quickly converging series of <em>n</em>-body terms.
				</p>

				</div><!-- .entry-content -->
				<p>
				We also have an ongoing interest in the use of the spin-flip framework (pioneered by Anna Krylov at USC) for describing several 
				types of strongly correlated systems within a single reference formalism.

				<h3><b>Quantum Computing <font size="8">&harr;</font> Quantum Chemistry  </b></h3>

				<p>
				Quantum computing devices and algorithms have been advancing at a fast pace. 
				However, unlike in traditional (classical) computing where the devices are largely determined by material properties,
					the small sizes of quantum bits, means that the device performance will be determined by both material <i>and</i> molecular properties. 
				This makes quantum chemistry a vital tool in understanding and optimizing molecular systems for use in quantum devices. 
				We are interested in developing methods and running simulations for understanding which chemical characteristics (and to what extent) affect the performance of single molecule magnets for quantum information purposes.

				<h3><b>Excited states in molecular materials</b></h3>
				<!--By incorporating photoactive molecules into a Metal Organic Framework (MOF),
				highly regular and long-range chromophoric arrays can be synthesized 
				to yield new materials displaying energy harvesting capabilities, 
				with potential for use in next generation energy solutions.-->

				We develop computational techniques to understand the detailed structure and mechanisms which 
				characterize such photoactive molecular materials, in an effort to design new materials
				with tailored photophysics.
				<p>
				In one  <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00545">recent approach</a>, we have used single-excitation wavefunctions (low-cost)
				to characterize multiexcitons in organic chromophore clusters. This approach works by establishing a one-to-one relationship between the elements
				of a Bloch-effective Hamiltonian obtained from one spin-flip calculations and a simple Heisenberg spin lattice.

				<h3><b>Efficient calculations of large molecules</b></h3>
				Accurate quantum chemistry is difficult to apply to large molecules because the 
				calculations quickly become too computationally demanding. 
				Approaches to solve this problem can often be divided into two categories: 
				Local orbital methods and Fragment-based methods. 
				Local orbital methods are more rigorous and have better error management, 
					but can be much more complicated and are often slow to crossover (become
					faster than conventional calculations).
				Fragment-based methods are much more simple, and can lead to quite accurate results,
					without the complexity overhead required to rewrite electron correlation methods 
					like CCSD(T). However, these methods rely more on heuristics than well-controlled approximations,
				       	and thus error management is more of a problem. 
				We have had an interest in these fragment-based approaches for some time. Two of our methods are described in the following papers: 
				<a href=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct200033b>MIM</a>, and
				<a href=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct300366e>MOB</a>.
